# A Data-Driven History of UK Fisheries

## Motivation
Target audience: Fisheries managers

Understanding the history of the fishing industry is essential for managers to make informed decisions about the future of fish stocks and implement policies that promote sustainable oceans. This data visualization app offers a comprehensive overview of the United Kingdomâ€™s fishing industry, drawing on reconstructed fisheries catch data from the [Sea Around Us Project](https://www.seaaroundus.org/).
With just a glance, users can grasp industry trends from 1950 to 2019, while interactive features allow for in-depth exploration and filtering of various aspects of the sector. Whether for research, policy planning, or personal interest, this app provides valuable insights into the evolution of UK fisheries.
